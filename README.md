# Zomato Dashboard  

## Overview  
I created this Power BI dashboard to analyze Zomato's user preferences, city performance, and cuisine trends. The report includes interactive features for dynamic data exploration, helping stakeholders understand key metrics like sales, user behavior, and order trends.  

## Steps to Create and Publish the Report  

### Data Loading and Preparation  
1. I sourced the data from web.  
2. Using Power BI's "Get Data" feature, I imported datasets into Power BI Desktop.  
3. I inspected and verified the structure of each dataset to ensure consistency in column names and data formats.  

### Data Transformation  
4. I cleaned the data by removing irrelevant columns, standardizing city names, and ensuring uniform formats.  
5. I added calculated columns and measures to capture metrics like total sales, orders, and dynamic red-text values for real-time updates.  
6. I verified the transformed data by cross-referencing with original data sources to ensure accuracy.  

### Report Design and Features  
7. I designed the dashboard with navigation icons on the right side for easy access to different sections:  
    - **Overview**: Displays key metrics such as overall ratings, total orders, and sales amount.  
    - **User Preferences**: Analysis of active, lost, and gained users by age and gender.  
    - **City Performance**: Insights into orders, sales, and user trends by city.  
    - **Cuisine Preference**: Detailed breakdown of sales by cuisine type, including veg, non-veg, and other categories.  
8. I used dynamic text (in red) to highlight real-time or frequently updated metrics.  
9. Visuals include:  
    - Bar charts for sales and orders across cities.  
    - Pie charts and KPIs for user preferences and cuisine breakdowns.  
    - Line charts for yearly sales trends.  
10. I applied a consistent design theme with appropriate fonts, colors, and spacing for an intuitive user experience.  

### Publishing and Sharing  
11. After completing the dashboard, I published it to the Power BI Service for accessibility.  
12. I shared the report with stakeholders via a Power BI link and embedded it into collaborative platforms like Microsoft Teams.  

## Features and Interactivity  
- **Navigation Icons**: Located on the right side, these icons enable seamless transitions between different sections of the dashboard.  
- **Dynamic Text**: Metrics displayed in red are dynamically updated to reflect real-time data changes.  
- **Filters and Slicers**: Users can filter data by city, year, and cuisine type for granular insights.
